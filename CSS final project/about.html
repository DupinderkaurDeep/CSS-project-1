      <h2>Punjabi Clothes & Outfits for Brides, Wedding Party and Guests</h2>
    <p>  <!-- Content about Punjabi wedding outfits -->
Punjabi weddings are among the most joyous and cheerful weddings. Their weddings are loaded with total enthusiasm and light-hearted banters. Punjabis often prefer a big fat wedding that would pump everyone with laughter, delicious meals, and great emotions. One aspect of such weddings that never fails to steal hearts is the Punjabi wedding wardrobe. Punjabi wedding outfits are no less than princess costumes. They are even finer as Punjabi wedding attires are further highlighted with beautiful handcrafted embroideries and eye-catchy stonework. Indian wedding dresses are known for their customary beauty and state-wise traditional wedding outfits. A Punjabi bride perfectly portrays the culture of Punjab with her pure red Punjabi bridal dress for the Anand Karaj, the Sikh wedding ceremony. The red designer lehenga choli or salwar suit is embroidered intricately with threadwork, beadwork, mirror, and sequins. The bridal Punjabi dupatta is commonly completed with fringed lace and striking golden thread work. Modern Punjabi bridal suits are a heavenly blend of grace and comfort. They are not restricted to just red color for bridal wear now. Colors like pastel blues and greens are also becoming very popular. The Punjabi groom's outfit is usually in shades of white, peach, and beige. They are highlighted with rich silver threads and paired with an elegant contrasting stole and a turban. Traditional Punjabi wedding dresses for females include distinct kinds of salwar kameez sets that are paired with heavily embellished dupattas to cover the head. The Kameez/Kurti will be short and fitted, whereas the Patiala salwar will be heavily pleated. Punjabi wedding dress for males includes wedding wear kurta pajama and a turban. It can be further set together with embroidered jackets. Punjabi bridesmaid dresses are majorly colored in pastels. Bridesmaids generally choose to wear simple yet elegant Anarkali suits or Patiala Punjabi suits for the wedding. They complete the overall look by keeping the complementary light embroidered dupattas over their heads. Coming to the Punjabi wedding outfits for guests, one thing to keep in mind is the color of the outfit. Punjabi wedding guest attires should not be in black and red as black is considered inauspicious, whereas red is the Indian bridal color. As a guest, you can wear any ethnic wear outfit like Anarkali suits, Pakistani wedding dresses, Punjabi suits, Indian Sarees, and alike.

  <h3 class="sectionTag big">Welcome to Punjab world!</h3>
  <p class="sectionSubTag small" >Punjabis are simple yet fun-loving people who believe in expressing their emotion with gusto. Similar to their nature, their weddings reflect their life philosophy. Punjabi weddings are colorful, loud, sometimes over the top, fun filled with lots of opportunities for singing and dancing one’s heart out. Punjabi weddings may be simple or lavish, but they ensure unlimited fun and celebration. A host of pre and post wedding rituals make a Punjabi wedding a lengthy and enjoyable affair. Although, Punjabis do not miss an opportunity to make merry, their weddings display their propensity towards adhering to age old traditions, albeit with a conventional twist to them sometimes. From elaborate lehengas to the noisy baratis, the ‘dance till you drop’ Sangeet to the extremely friendly and warmly-welcoming host, a Punjabi wedding is akin to a true roller-coaster. </p>
